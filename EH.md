### **Introduction to Ethical Hacking**
Ethical hacking is the authorized practice of bypassing system security to identify vulnerabilities that malicious hackers could exploit.
Objectives


- Improve system security


- Identify vulnerabilities before attackers do


- Protect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability


- Support penetration testing & security audits



2. **Types of Hackers**
 **Black Hat Hackers**- Unauthorized access- Malicious intent Aim to steal, damage, or disrup.

**White Hat Hackers** - Authorized access with an aim to Improve security.Also known as ethical hackers

**Grey Hat Hackers**
Semi-authorized or unauthorized access,Not malicious but still illegal,Sometimes report vulnerabilities

3. **Phases of Ethical Hacking**
- Reconnaissance (Information Gather information) 
**types of Reconnaissance**
- Passive Recon → collecting info without interacting
- Active Recon → interacting with target systems

**Tools**

- WHOIS
- nslookup
- Shodan
- Maltego

2.**Scanning** - Identifying live systems, open ports, and services.

- **Scanning Techniques**

- Port scanning

- Network scanning

- Vulnerability scanning


**Tools**
- Nmap
- Nessus
- OpenVAS

3. **Gaining Access** -Exploiting vulnerabilities to enter a system.

**Techniques**

- Password cracking

- SQL injection

- Exploit kits

- Malware

4. **Maintaining Access**-Ensuring the attacker (ethical hacker) can reenter the system for analysis.

**Methods**

- Creating backdoors

- Privilege escalation

- Rootkits



5.**Covering Tracks** -Ethical hackers simulate clearing logs to understand attacker behavior.

**Examples**

- Clearing system logs

- Deleting evidence

- Modifying timestamps (timestomping)



       **Common Attack Vectors**
1. Social Engineering

- Phishing

- Pretexting

- Baiting

- Tailgating

2. Network Attacks


- MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)

- Packet sniffing

- DoS/DDoS

- ARP poisoning

3. Web Application Attacks

- SQL Injection

- XSS (Cross-site Scripting)

- CSRF

- Directory traversal


4. Wireless Attacks


- Evil twin attacks

- Wi-Fi cracking

- Rogue access points



5. Penetration Testing Types
 - Black Box Testing - No prior knowledge of the system.It Simulates an external attacker.

2. White Box Testing - Full knowledge of system architecture.Simulates an insider

3. Grey Box Testing-Partial knowledge.Balanced and efficient

     **Legal & Ethical Considerations**
***Always Ensure:***

- Written authorization before testing

- Clear scope of testing

- Report all findings

- No damage to systems or data


   **Computer Misuse Laws**
**Ethical hackers must avoid:**

- Unauthorized access

- Data theft

- Disruption of service

- Privacy violations

**Cybersecurity Frameworks**


- ISO 27001

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework

- OWASP Top 10

- CIS Controls



    - *OWASP Top 10 2021*

- Broken Access Control

- Cryptographic Failures

- Injection

- Insecure Design

- Security Misconfiguration

- Vulnerable Components

- Identification & Authentication Failures

- Software Integrity Failures

- Security Logging & Monitoring Failures

- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)


  **Best Practices for Ethical Hackers**

- Stay updated with security trends

- Practice on legal platforms (TryHackMe, HackTheBox, DVWA)

- Document everything

- Use VMs (Kali Linux, Parrot)

- Always follow proper ethics & law
